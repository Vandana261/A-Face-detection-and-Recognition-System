A Face-detection and Recognition System to detect and validate faces in digital images.


Use of face recognition for the purpose of attendance marking is the smart way of the attendance management system. Face recognition is a more accurate and faster technique than other techniques and reduces the chance of proxy attendance. Face recognition provides passive identification that a person which is to be identified does not need to take any action for its identity. Maintaining the attendance record with day-to-day activities is a challenging task. The conventional method of calling the name of each student is time consuming and there is always a chance of proxy attendance. 

The following system is based on face recognition to maintain the attendance record of students. Face recognition involves two steps, the first step involves the detection of faces, and the second step consists of identification of those detected face images with the existing dataset. Attendance monitoring is a very important process in almost all organizations and institutions. Nowadays there are two types of systems available: the first is manual and the second is automated. The most used method for taking attendance is totally automated based. It uses python high level language and currently advanced level of open CV source to use in this system. The objective of this project is to perform face recognition in order to produce the details of the student. Who attends class and in order to link the attendance to the subject. The data is already saved in the memory. To detect the face and recognize the face and mark the attendance.
